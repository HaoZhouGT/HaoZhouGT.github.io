## Soccer & Running

<br>I started playing soccer when I was 10 years old, and in middle school I used to play for **NJ Starhawks** as a winger. In high school, I led my class to **win the championship** of school's soccer league, playing as a back. In college, I joined the Automation College soccer team and the Nanjing Information Engineering University soccer team, playing as a center forward. I once scored two goals in ten minutes in a soccer league game.

In addition, I'm a middle-distance jogger amateur. I once won the third in the men's 1500m event at the college games. During the week, I also go to the gym and jog for an hour. Running allows me to make appointments for my body and mind, releases stress, and allows me to be more focused in my work. As my favorite author, Haruki Murakami, says, no matter how insignificant an action is, as long as you keep at it day after day, something like an objective perception will always come out of it. <br>





## Cooking

        <p>I really enjoy cooking, it's something that gives me a sense of fulfillment. I specialize in braised dishes and modern improvements of some traditional dishes. I am also very passionate about experimenting with food. If you are interested, you can join me in exploring the cuisines of different countries and regions.</p>
