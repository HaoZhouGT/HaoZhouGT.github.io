# About Me

<img src="Yuhang.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Hi, I'm **Hao Zhou**, an Assistant Professor at the University of South Florida.

Research statement: In this new era of transportation featuring self-driving and machine learning, challenges of reducing traffic congestion are still out there, if not getting worse. We believe such limitations are due to the lack of a good combination of new technologies and old theories. To fill the gap, we are particularly interested in teaching new technologies old tricks, i.e., incorporating traffic flow/network knowledge into self-driving/machine learning for traffic control. 

If you are interested in our research, please email me at - *haozhou1[at]usf[dot]edu*

## Research Interests

- Autonomous Vehicles
- Traffic Security
- Driver Assisted System
- Large Language Models
- Computer graphics

My current research focuses on applying deep learning and the features of self-driving vehicles to solve transportation problems. I believe that the combination of old theories and emerging technologies can help alleviate the problem of traffic congestion and ensure traffic safety. I am also committed to a human-centered approach and to researching automated driver assistance systems that are more suitable for a wide range of people and that add to the driver's driving experience. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
