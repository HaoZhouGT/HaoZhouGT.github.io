**Technologies: Our Philosophy to Reduce Traffic Congestion** <br>

---

## MOTIF Lab

In this new era of transportation featuring self-driving and machine learning, challenges of reducing traffic congestion are still out there, if not getting worse. We believe such limitations are due to the lack of a good combination of new technologies and old theories. To fill the gap, we are particularly interested in teaching new technologies old tricks, i.e., incorporating traffic flow/network knowledge into self-driving/machine learning for traffic control. <br>
